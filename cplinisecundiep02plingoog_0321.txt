Poppaeo, 111. 9). Hardy’s note gives a convenient enumeration of
the privileges attached to the ine triam liberorum: (l) inheritance of
legacies left to caelibes, which the latter were forbidden to take (ca-
duca), (2) preference ia petendis honoribus ; (3) holding offices before
the legal age or without the legal interval; (l) preference in the
assignment of provinces; (5) precedence before equals and colleagues;
(6) exemption from the duties of tutor and iudec; (1) mitigation of

· punishment in certain cases. Wise emperors grantedthe 1101111011

grant was strictly personal, and did not benefit the heirs of the persons
concerned, nor was it in any way assignable.

5. illo tristissimo saeculo: Domitian’s reign.

6. duobus matrimoniis: this evidently means two marriages in
Domitian’s reign. On the other hand, the letters about Calpurnia
seem to refer to a recent marriage, and are evidently to be dated well
011 in Trajan's reign. Hence we infer that Calpurnia was the third
wife oi l‘liny; see Introduction, page xviii.

8. patrem fieri: 10., obtain the privileges of a father, become a
pater in the eye of the law. With the general sentiment of this sen-

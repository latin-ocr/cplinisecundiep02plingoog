Ihave to thank several of my eolleagues for valuable
information upon matters which eome within the sphere
of their special knowledge, but most of all the general ฮผ
editors for their faithful and sympathetie coeperation in
all stages of my work. To them are due, in greater measure
than they are willing to aeknowledge, whatever merits the

book may prove to possess

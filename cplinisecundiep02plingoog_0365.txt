ΑΝ attempt has been made in this volume to present in simple

and convenient form the assistance needed by young stu—
dents making their first acquaintance with Livy.

The editor's experience in the class-room has led him to anno-
tate the text copiously. On the other hand, that fulness of illus-
tration which apparently aims to supersede the function of the
teacher has been carefully avoided.

Professor James Η. ninam, Tulane University, New Orleam, Las l
should like to say that Westcott's Livy is the most satisfactory text-book
that 1 know of. Other works may put on a greater show of learning*
but when one comesto every-day class-room use, the editing of this text
is found to be exceptionally satisfactory.

Professor charles Ε. Bennett, Cornell Universily, Ithaca, N. Y. : lt seems
to me an excellent book. The notes-are exceedingly fresh and scholarly;
they call attention to the right things in the right way. This editicn is
superior to any similar edition with which l am acquainted.

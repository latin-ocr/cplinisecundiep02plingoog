10. illam: the word implies something well known or commonly
believed. Gierig, in his note on this passage, cites 2 number of pas-
sages showing the common belief that the world and the gods would
one day iall back into chaos and night, out of which all things issued
in the beginning. ¹

12. Aderant qul . . . nuntiabant: note the indicative 111 the

Pago 89. 2. 11011 scripturus: this letter does not, as the loth
does, purport to be material iorTacitus's history. Pliny’s modesty
about it seems exaggerated. It is a question whether he ever wrote
anything finer; it is worthy‚ in style, 01 Tacitus himself.

Lord Lyttleton (1760), in his Dialogues os tlte Dead (No. 7), rep
resents the elder Pliny as upbraiding his nephew ior vanity and
affectation 111 his style generally, and particularly in his conduct at
the time oi the eruption 01 Vesuvius.

3. He is therefore obliged to consider Epp. od Trahit and 9 as out of
the chronological order in which all the other letters of the group stand.

4. ln Ep. Vl. 29, where Pliny names the five great cases inwhich
he had been counsel, that of classicae, with regard to its second main
discussion, -is named before that oi Marius Priscus.

The expression nate memoriam meam, in Ep. 11. 14. 3, and the
general tone of that letter mark Pliny as advanoed in life.

Thus Peter goes through the books in order, finding a number of
letters which seem to him inconsistent with the chronological arrange-
ment oi Mommsen, his final conclusion being that we cannot accept
Mommsen's scheme of arrangement-a purely negative conclusion.

Summing up, our verdict would be as follows ι The scheme arranged
by Mommsen commenda itself in its main features. Certain points
may be considered as insufficiently established, but they do not invali-
date the conclusions as a whole. Tm argument is a constructive one,
in which the different parts, leading to a common obJ'ect, have cumn-
lative force. Destructive argument is relatively sasier. conclusions
may be attached, or even refuted, and nothing put in their place.
Some of the objections to Mommsen’s positions are undoubtedly fanci-
ful or unsound, some may be admitted to be convincing in detail. In

one important particular the case against Mommsen’s view is very
strongly supported; that is, in the matter of the date of the trial of
Classicus and all that is involved thercin. We may modify our
acceptence of Mommsen's chronology to the extent of adopting the
conclusions of Stobbe and Peter in this respect, while believing it to
be substantially' correct as a whole.

latable. An estate which was burdened with an ‘easement’ for the
benefit of another estate was called seruiens. Thus the lake lying
below the villa, and lending itseli to the view, was a permanent
enhancement of its charm.

THE cunonotoeY OF THE LETTERS

Jon. Messon published at Amsterdam, in 1709, his Plinii Secundi
iunioris vita ordine chronolopico sic dipeata ut ouria dilucidentur
historiae Romanae puncta quae Flauianos Imperatores uti Nervam
et Traianum spectmu. (Prefixed ιο Arntzen’s edition of the Pane-
gyric, Amst. 1738.)

The most important contribution in recent times ιο this subJ'ect is
Mommsen’s article in Hennes, 111. pp. 31-139, Zur Lebenspesclticltte
dec jiinperen Plinius.

Mommsen minimizes the significance of the phrase in Ep. I. l, non
cerroto temporis ordine, and concludes thet upon the whole, though
not in every particular, the arrangement of the letters is chronological,
and also that Pliny himself issued all nine books at successive dates.
The latter point may be inferred not merely from the well known
practice of publishing literary works in instalments, but also from
Ep. IX. 19, significas lepicse te in quadam epistula rnea, referring ιο
Ep. VI. 10, and from Ep. VII. 28, addressed to the same person
as Ep. Ι. 1, justifying the author’s praising of his friends. Mommsen
argues that letters on the same subject, or otherwise evidently synchro-
nous, are found in the same book or in consecutive books, and con·
versely that two certainly synchronous letters are never far separated,
and that of a pair of letters the laterone never comes first in the col-
lection. A similar chronological order is traced in the references to
certain persons, e.g., M. Regulus and Calestrius Tiro, in the references
to Pliny’s marriages and ιο the relatives of his wives. A gradual
change is observed in the list of Pliny's correspondents, older men
appearing in the earlier books, younger in the later ones, while men
of the author’s own age appear all through the collection.

Paga 3. letter 4. This letter appears tc have been written after
January l, 97, but before the death of Nerva An account of (0. ii-
cinius) Voconius Romanus (cf. C.I.L. ΙΙ. 3860. asota) isgiveniu
Ep. ΙΙ. 13. From this letter, and from ad Trai. 4, it appears that he
was Pliny's fellow-student aud comrade in arms, that he wasan ad·
vocate, a flamen ci llither Spain (see note on Ep. Il. 13. 4), that Pliny
obtained lor him the ius trium liberorum from Nerva, and the lates
clavus from Trajan. Epp. Ι. t ; 111.13 are addressed to voconius
Romanus ; Epp. ΙΙ. l; VI. lt, VI. 33; VllI. 8; IX. 7; lx. 2ss
to Romanus. Demogect (Pliac le Jeuue, Lettres Ohotsies) says thav
Romanus became a friend of Hadrian, who composed his epitaph:
Lascivus versat, mente pudieus erut.

1. M. Regulo: M. Aquilius Regulus rose to great wealth and
power under Nero by ‘deletion’ Accused at the beginning ol Vespa·
sian's reign, he was defended in the senate by his half-brother, the

. eloquent L. Vipstanus Messalla. Tac. Hist. IV. ta. The charges

against him detailed by Tacitus tend to confirm our belief in the just-
ness cf Pliny’s opinion. Martial’s eifusive compliments to Regulus,
Epig. l. 12 ; 82 ; 111; IV. 16, count for nothing as testimonials tc his
character. lle stands almost alone as an object of open scorn and
detestation to Pliny, who is nearly always mild and charitable in his
J'udgments. Pliny tells three scandalous stories about him, Ep. II. 20;
describes his tasteless and hypocritical mcurning at his son’s death,
Ep. lV. 7 ; but after his death mourns his loss to the legal profession,
Ep. Vl. 2. timidiorem humiliorem: Regulus feared punishment
for his crimes, after the death oi his patron Domitian. But in dealing
with informers, as in many other respecta, the government of Nerva
showed itsell moderate, not to say feeble. , Observa the asyndeton ;
this isa noticeable feature of Pliny’s style, but the same may be said
of many authors who labor much after striking effecta.

3. tectiore: the free comparison oi participial adjectivae, which
marks the Silver Age of Latin, is already noticeable in Livy.

5. Rustici Aruleni: L. J unius Arulenus Rusticus, a stuic, pupil oi
Paetus Thrasea, was put to death in l.1›.93 for writing a panegyrio
on Thrasea and Helvidius Priscus ; the book was publioly burned; ci.

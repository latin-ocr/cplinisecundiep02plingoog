Another important contribution to the subJ‘ect is that oi C. Peter
(Zur Oltroaoloyic cler Briese des jtnperen Plinius, Philologus, XXXII.
698 sqq.).

Peter criticises Mommsen’s view that it is always true that letters
whose dates can be fixed fit into the chronological order and that the
others are not inconsistent with it, and especially the opinion that no
letters were written before the death 01 Domitian. He thinks but
little weight is to be attached to the fact that wherever two letters
have a connection the later one always stands later in the collection,
that letters about the same subiect or 01 the same period come in the
same book or in two consecutive books. In the same light he regards
the argument of Mommsen about the age of the correspondents, ob
sarving that most correspondents get but a single letter.

Then follow the positive inferences which Peter draws. In the letters
oi the 4th and tth books Pliny appears as a poet, and a lyric poet at
that. But in Ep. v11.4 he says that 110 has nunc primam made an
essay in hendecasyllabics, while in Ep. VIII. 21 he calls the collection
01 his poems inusteas liber, and in Ep. lx. 34 himself a novus poeto.
Hence these letters must have been written earlier than those in books
4and 5.

He finds that Epp. IV. 3, IV. 18, and V. 15, to Arrius Antonius
are not in the right order; also that the same is true 01 Epp. vin. 1
and IX. 34, and of Epp. ΙΙ. 11, II. 123 compared with Epp. 111.4,
111.9.

With reference to Ep. Il. 9, he argues that it disproves the idea
that the letters oi the id book go only to the beginning 01 100, 011
account of chronological considerations, 'which‚ he states, render it
impossible that Erucius should have 'been a candidate 101 the tribune-
ship in 100.

The most careiul attention is devoted to the date 01 the trial of
Classicus, which Mommsen places in 101, forgetting, as Peter claimS,
the fact that the case 01 Marius (Ep. II. 11) was twice under discus
sion, -once about May, 99, and again in January, 100. The decision
on the first occasion was that civil proceedings should go on first, and

meantime co-defendants and witnesses 101 the criminal proceedings
should be brought from the provinca. Peter’s opinion is aa follows:

The trial 01 Classicus is to be dated in September, 99, 101

1. Both Marius Priscus and Classicus governed provinces in the
· same year.

2. Mommsen is obliged to assume that Pliny was praejectus aerarii
Saturni for iour years, which is without example.

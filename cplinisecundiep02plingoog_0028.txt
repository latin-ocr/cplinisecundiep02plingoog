not a ease of haphazard survival, nor yet of posthumous
editing by avstranger. We have the satisfaction of knowing
that the collection contains just what the writer intended
it should. We are not troubled with misgivings, therefore,
in forming our estimato of him. As he tells his own story,
we may take him at his word. It is eminently fitting that
such a man, and the representative of such an age, should
appear before the world in a literary toilet thus care·
fully arranged. Letters which showed him en
castabala, so to speak, or betrayed him at an
unguarded moment, when he for-got his pose, if he ever had
such a moment, would he out of keeping. Pliny in a state
of nature would not be the real Pliny. He is least artificial
in the letters to Trajan, but he is not there at his best.
We appreciate his abilities and his conscientious endeavors
as an administrator. But he is out of his clement at such
a post as the governorship of a troublesome province. No
doubt he was proud to be trusted, but the position clearly
worried hirn, and in his heart he pined for the brilliant
society of Rome or the calm literary reposo of his villas.

Pliny’s chief excellence as a writer is his clecvness, and
the chief clement of his charm is his modevnness, of thought

singular felicity of Melmoth's translation in ffi⁰sdei¹rff¹t²⁰⁸⁸
‘ Johnsonese! Warton said of this version that p
it bettered the original. While we might not be willing to
goso far as that, we do feel that the extraordinary appro
priateness of its eighteenth century English to the Latin of
the original letters stamps Pliny as in many respects a
kindred spirit with the English authors of that time.

Το sum up our impressions,-Pliny is the most amiable
of the ancient writers. Not only is he admir-
able in all private relations, but nothing unkind

is said by hirn of any contemporaries while they live, except

Book I.

Bp. b was written before the return 01 J unius Mauricus from exile,
which occurred after Jan. l, 91, but probably not long aiter Nerve’s
accession, aad certainly in 1110 reign.

Ep. 12. The death 01 Corellius Baius seems to have taken place
not long aiter that oi Domitian, but he was still alive when Pliny ap-

Epp.4 and 9, about the trial 01 Classicus, Mommsen thinks must
have been written in the autumn oi 101. This is a mooted point. It

other writers

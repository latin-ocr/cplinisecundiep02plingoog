Η10 epigrams, about 1550 in number, are extant. See Appendix L
Pliny’s harmiess vanity gives the epigram written in his honor another
chance 01 surviving by incorporatlng it into his letter, a precaution
which Martial’s lame has rendered unnecessary.

25. salis . . . iellls. . ¹candoris: wit satire frontosae
(or good-nature). Martial uses the first two words and the adjective

‘⁶ 'l'he ‘candor' noted in him by Pliny is simply that oi a sheet 01

He may claim the merit -nor is it an inconsiderable one - oi being

priate ,⁰ cl. line 23 01 the epigram, hoec hora esi tac, etc. The metre

pronoun or adjective would be allowed.”

16. Arpinis. . . chartis: i.e., the speeches 01 Cicero, who wasa

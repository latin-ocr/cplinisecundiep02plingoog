PLINY’S snm

Tho stylo of Pliny may be generally characterized by
two statements which at first seem inconsistent. He was
undoubtedly an imitator of Cicero, and at the same time
he was a true representative of the Silwer Age.

In his smooth, copious fluency he is like his avowed
master and model, Cicero: in his diction, his forms of ex-
pression, his syntax, he shows a striking affinity with the
chief prose writers of his own time, Quintilian, his teacher,
and Tacitus, his friend.

Compared with the men oi his own generation, he is freer
than any from the peculiar faults of the Latinity of the
time, and exhibits the least departure from the language in
its strictly classical forms. Yet no man can escape the
influencc of his age and environmcnt, and it is therefore
only natural that even in Pliny we find many neologisms,
many words tho sense of which has been altered, many
poetic expressions transferred to prose, many rare and iar-
fetched constructions, over-frequent figures of speech, and,
in general, a style marked by somewhat excessivo antithesis,
and not freefrom artificial conceits. And yet it is, withal,

a good style, always interesting, sometimes beautiful, hero
and there exhibiting a nervous vigor worthy of Tacitus.

Following are some of the features of Pliny's diction and
stylc, which, though not necessarily peculiar to him, may
be fairlyregarded as characteristic. The examples under
each head are to be taken merely as illustrative,not asan

exhaustivc list. No examples have been given which do
not occur in the letters of this collection.

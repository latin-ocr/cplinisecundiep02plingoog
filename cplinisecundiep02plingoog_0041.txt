xxxvi mraonuorrorr. 11

b. Parenthesis: forty-one cases have been counted in the
first four books.

c. Asyndeton both of words and sentences is frequent.

Of sentences: in rapid narrative with much detail; eg,

1. ὃς 11. 10 (seven sentences); 11. 18. 2.

Of words: the three-membered asyndeton is developed
into a deoided mannerism‚ about one hundred instances
being counted in the letters and about thirty in the
l’anegyri03 eg„ vn. 33. 10. Ι
It often leads to an· excessivo multiplicatiori of words.

There are about forty cases of asyndeton of two members,
and about twenty withmere than three members.

d. Polysyndeton is comparatively infrequent; about
thirty instanccs are counted.

e. Anaphora is very characteristic of such a rhetorical
stylo as l’liny’s, and was in general strongly developed in
the Silver Age. Pliny uses it even in simple passages of
quiet description, but in the Panegyric there are said to be
thirty-six cases in the first fifteen chapters, and seven in
tho thirty-fourth chapter alone.

s. Hendiadys3 perhaps but one instance:

novitatem odoremque, rx, 33. 9.

A sort of verbal hendiadys is illustrated in

componere et transigere, v. l. 7.

y. Aposiopesis:

Interim Miseni epo et neuter . . .‚ v1.16.21.

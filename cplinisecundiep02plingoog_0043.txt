o. Fcndness for pairs oi nearly synonymcus words:

gloria famaque . . . adsensio et leus, rv. 12. 6.
vetas et anticum, 111. 6. 3.

Sometimes three such words are grouped:

by all writers.

Murmur, x. 19.

N ec doctum satis et parum severum,
Sed non rusticulum nimis libellum
Facundo mea Plinio Thalia

I perfer: brevis et labor peractae
Altum vincere tramitem Suburae.

Illic Orphea protinus videbis

Udi vertice lubricum theatri
Mirantesque feras avemque regis,
Raptum quae Phryga pertulit Tonanti ;

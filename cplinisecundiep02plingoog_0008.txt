Turne are already before the public so many editions
of Selections from Pliny’s hetters that I should not have
ventured, without the invitation of the general editors of
this series, to put forth another. Compliance with their
request, however, has been a labor ol love, and Ι trust
it may prove not altogether labor lost.

The publication of the whole of the Letters, with an
adequate commentary in English, has for some time seemed
to me a very desirable work, -a work which Ι should like
in future to attempt, should it not meantime be undertaken
. by one better qualified for the task. Such an edition
should be based upon a new reading of the manuscripts,
as is conspicuously shown by a comparison of Keil’s edition
with Professor Merrill's collation of the Codex Riccardianas
in the American Journal of Plrilolopy‚ for December, 1895.

My obligations in the preparation of my Introduction
and Notos, have been chiefly to Mommsen’s important
article on the Younger Pliny, in Hermes, III.; to Kraut’s
and Lagergren's dissertations on the language and style of
Pliny; and in a more general sense to the various editors
cited in the list on page xli of the Introduction and the
Abbreviations on page 128. Indebtedness in detail I have
been careful to acknowledgc specifically.

The text is that of Keil, with a few changes.

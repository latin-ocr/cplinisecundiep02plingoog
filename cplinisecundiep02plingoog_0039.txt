ὅ 7. ansns

o. The epistolary tenses are seldom used. This is because
the letters are such rather in form than in essenee. The
epistolary use is most frequent in the letters to Trajan.
There is an extensive use of the historioal present, and
some instances of the present indicative ‘for the future in
protasis.

Upon the whole, Pliny's use of the tenses cannot be con·
sidored as far from normal.

ἓ 8. Mooos

o. The subjunctive of iteration or generaliz‘ation in rela
tive sentences:

quocumque me contulissem, v1. 10. 2.
quotiens . . . intraret, 111.16.4.

. b. The subjunctive often follows quamquam. Kraut,
ἓ 39, says there are ten such cases.

c. Si modo regularly takes the indicative unless oratio
obliqua requires the subjunctive.

a. naamon weh tue subjunctive rs used of facts, n'0e
merely of argumentative concessions.

c. Substantive clauses, the objects of verbs of oshiay,
admonisht'oy, biddt'ay, and the like, are often used without
et,· eg, after seqare, orere, petere, postolare, hortari, necuere,
censere, optare, carcre. Of the thirty instances after royore,
twenty are without ot.

Iubere takes this construction, instead of the infinitiva.

In rx. 33.11 occurs the unique instance of the subjunctive
without ut after opus est. ’

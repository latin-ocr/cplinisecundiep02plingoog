61 authority. Audit is clear that many Romans 61 that
over-civilized age had a real teste for the enjoyment 61
country seats during a partos 1116 year, and their litera
ture from Catullus onis full 61 appreciation 61
the milder and lovelier aspects 61 nature. They
delighted in a trim garden or well-kept park,

Roman view
of nature

in the 6611, sweet beauty 61 6 peaoeful landscape,1·emind-
ing us not a little in this respect 61 the English poets 61 the
eighteenth century.

One so enthusiastic in his interest in literature as Pliny,
may be supposed to have tried his hand at

wrote verses pretty much every sort Of wriffing· He con·

sesses, Ep. IV. 27 : -

Ego interdum 6616111116 ludo.

More than once we find a mention oi his ‘hendecasyllabios’
which 116 appears 16 regard with a certain amount 61 indul-
gence, and which 116 hints, not without a suspicion 61 glee‚
are justa little naughty. One cannot help smiling at the
care taken by so excellent a man to assure us that he was
awicked follow 61161 all in his lighter moments. He 661-
tainly had not the qualities 61 6 poet, and the loss 61 his
verses is not one to be deeply deplored. No doubt they
were elever and ingenious, but wholly academie. Even
Cicero, when he tried 16 write poetry, could only produce
admirable prosody.

Pliny's extant works are the Panegyric and the two collee
11666 61 1611616, vin: nine books 61 general 66116-
spondeum, and one containing the letters to

Trajan. These last are, in most cases, accompanied by the
emperor's replies. The dates of the several books are dis·
cussed in Appendix I. Suffice it to say here, that the
w„ his selection 61 111616116161 and their arrangement
own editor were the work 61 the author himself. It is

¹ Ι.6., the nine books.

Boon VIII.

Ep. 23 cannot have been written before 198 or 109 if Avitus is the
one mentioned ln the testament 01 Dasumius.

Boon IX.

'I'hIs Is the poorest of all in dates Possibly VIII. and IX. were
issued together; all we can be sure of is that they were not Issued
before 108 or 109.

Tun conansronnnncs wrrn Taum Is independent of the chief
collection, which never had more than nine books.

Epp. 1 and 2 come at the beginning of Trajan's reign.

Epp. 3-14 1211 in the period before Pliny's leporio ln Bithynia.

Epp. 11-121211 concern that leporio, so far as they admit any ln·
ference as to date, place, and clrcumstance. Few of them can have
been written anywhere else.

Mommsen points out the important datum for this serles. PIIny
mentions several times a Calpurnius Macer, a contemporary governor,
his nearest neighbor, a commender of legions. IIIs province must
have been Lower Moesia (CIL. ΙΙΙ. 777). consideration of thIs and
other known facts leads Mommsen todate the leyatt'o from 111,
September, to 113, January. '

Mommsen’s chronology 01 Pliny’s lifeis followed in the biographical
portion of the Introducti0n.

H. T. Stobbe (Zur Chronoloyz‘e der Brt'ese dea Plinius, Philologus,
XXX. 347-393) embodies the results of his own investigation, which
was Independent of Mommsen’s. The conclusions which he reaches
are somewhat different.

His discussion involves many 01 the same points as that 01 Peter
(see below), and his objections are mainly directed agaInst Mommsen’s
dating 01 the proceedings agaInst Classicus in 101. He thinks that
Pliny undertook the case in the autumn 01 99, while that 01 PrIscus
was still pending. If this was so, it would not be necessary to assume,
as Mommsen does, that the 8th and 9th letters in the correspondence
with Trajan are out of place in the group 3-11, where all the others
are in strict order 01 time.

The principa] distInctive feature of Stobbe’s dissertation is an
elaborate consideration of the times and distances involved in the
correspondence supposed to have been carried on, by means of the
state couriers, between Pliny in Italy and Trajan in Pannonia, in
the summer of 99.

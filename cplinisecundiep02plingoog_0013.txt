factory picture we have of the imperial age of Rome, at the
beginning of the second century, when the empire was in
its prime. Taking all its iaults and limitations into ao
count, it was still a great age, worthy of the oanvas of an
artist. The character oi the last generation of the repub
lio had been largely determined by Cicero's intellectual
activity. Pliny was no epoch-maker, but he attained a
rare success in portraying for the world of after times tho
happier, more oheerful, and more virtuous aspeots of the

age in which he lived. Juvenal and Tacitus,
ἱῖῗξῐῖἱῗέῃ his contemporaries, were vastly superior to him
anu Tacitus in genius, but they were both pessimistio in

tone3 the grim narrative of the historian is an
even more terrific indictment of the age than the diatribes
of the satirist. Their picturas are all shadows.‘ Pliny's
are brighter, and we cannot escape the conviction that they

are truer for the average of life.

Pliny’s career was 'peaoeful, busy, prosperous. He was
farored by his circumstances but his iudustry fairly earned
the success which so richly rewarded it.

geticofficial. Vespasian, rough soldier though he was, besides
being a sagacious practical ruler, had the good sense to encour-
age literature. Among all his subordinates none was more
trusted than the Elder Pliny, wh0, in ii ao, dedicated his
encyclopaedic ‘Natural History' to Vespasian’s son Titus.
Doubtless the circumstance that Pliny was brought up by
this uncle rather than by his father had an influence upon
his after career. The uncle was a prodigy of industry, as

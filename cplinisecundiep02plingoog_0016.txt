Lina OT PLINY xi

Young Pliny was so fortunate, moreover‚ as to have for his
guardian¹ no less a man than Verginius Rufus,
whose importanoe is sufficiently indicated by the
fact that he thrice refused the imperial purple.

With two such sponsors, it is not surprising that our
Pliny’s career in politica, at the bar, and in literature should
have begun early. His own ability, reinforced by hard
work, enabled him to grasp the success which rare social
and educational advantages put within his reach.

Great pains were taken with his bringing up. The condi-
tions of life among the Romans were then such
that almost the only way to practical success
was the career of the orator. Hence the education ota

’ gentleman was intended to train him to be an effective public
speaker, and ‘ rhetoric' was synonymous with a liberal edu-
cation‚ general as well as special. Cato's definitiom-

well expressed the Roman ideal of an earlier age. The
most complete exposition of the system of education in
vogue in the first century is found in the great work of
Quintilian, the Institutio Oratoric. Quintilian was one of
Pliny’s teachers3-that schoolmaster who be-
came consul, and whose career shows the esteem
in which ‘ rhetoric’ then stood. Another was the celebrated
Nicetes Sacerdos froin Smyrna⁴

- It may have been at this period that Pliny's life-long
friendship with Tacitus began. The only event in this early
part of his life of which we have detailed knowledge is the
memorable eruption of Vesuvius in 79 Ab„ when
he was in his eighteenth year. The story is
told in two letters to Tacitus.⁵ One of them

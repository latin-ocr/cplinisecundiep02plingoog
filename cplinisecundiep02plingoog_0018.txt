positions open to consularsalone.1 By way of preliminary
qualifications, the young aspirant to the corruo bonornm
was required to fill one of the minor annual magistraoies,
collectively called the Vigintivirate,² and to serve at least a
nominal term in the army as tribanus militum latmlaoius,
ostensibly as aide on the staff of some governor of a province
who commanded troops. Hence we often hear of the semeo-
stris militia of a tribunus tonores petiturus. Pliny was Xoir
stlitibus iudicandis³ in 81 or 82. His military tribuneship
was spent in Syriu,⁴ where he was attached to the third
legion, ‘Gallica' and employed in clerical work connected
with the accounts of the army.⁵ At this time he must have
been twenty or a little older. After returning to Rome, he
obtained the quaestorship, the lowest senatorial
office. As the minimum age for this was twenty-
five,⁶ he cannot have held it before 87, It seems most
probable that his term was from July 1, 89, to June 30, 90.
The fact that he was quaestor Caesario indicates that he was
in high favor with the emperor Domitian at this time. The
lec annolie, which fixed the age at which each office might
bo held, also required an interval of at least a year between
the first and second, and between the second and third,
and of two years between the third and fourth offices. We
know that Pliny was praetor 11193.7 Meantime
ho had been tribune of the plebs,⁸ probably froin
Dec. 10, 91, to Dec. 9, 923 the year's interval between trib

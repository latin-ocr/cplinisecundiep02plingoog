11111166 611111 xxxvii

11. Ellipsis. 111 the extent of his use of this figure
Pliny hardly exceeds Cicero (in his letters) and Tacitus.

1. The most common form is the omission 61 forms
of the verb ‘to he.' Pliny is peeuliar in not con-
fining ellipsis to eat, 611111, and esse, but in extending
it to other m00ds‚ other tenses, and other persons.

2. His omission of verba dicendi, 1116661161, 11961161,
· ete, is nat peculiar. It tends to brevity, and
they are easily supplied.

3. Sometimes there is a continuans effert to 6661116
brevity. An example 61 this is the whole of Ep. 1.5.

1. Similes are frequent.

j. Coneinnity is elaborate, antithesis is constantly aimed
at.

lc. Oxymoron:

morti . . . immortalem aleriam, v1.1e.1.
semper victuras occiderit, vr. 16. 2.
percantatio inter aaa, 111. 19. 4.

l. Assonanee:

faeere scribenda aut seribere tenenda, vr. 16. 3.

m. Repetition of a word with change of form:

ratio rationem . . . timorem timor, vr. 16. 16.
ta emiliam eesilii causam, v11. 19. 6.

a. Repetition 61 6 word in the same form:

de vita etas . . . de 6116116611, rv. 7. 2.
111 praefectura . . „fuit suit et 111 coarmata, v. 14. 6.

But there is evident care not to repeat a word too often
in quiek succession. Note, 161 instance, in Ep.11. 17. 5
and 6, the variety of words 161 ‘ prospect!

11. exparte quarta: the Falcidian law of sc. 40 enacted that
an heir should have at least a clear fourth of the estate, and that not
more than three-fourtlrs should be left in legacies to others. If the
natural heirs were disinherited for no sufficient reason, they could
contest the will by an action called querela inofficiosi testamenti.
This could be preveuted by leaving theru one-fourth of what they
would have received if the testator had died intestate. Such a fourth
was called the portio lepitima. Cf. Hunter‚ Roman Lura index, un-
